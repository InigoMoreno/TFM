abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have received an increasing amount of attention recently with many applications being actively investigated across the globe, and several related open research questions being actively pursued. Possible applications include search and rescue, disaster relief, environmental monitoring and surveillance, transportation, and construction. Transportation of cable suspended payloads using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is one such application which is the topic of this research. Autonomous transportation of objects using UAV can contribute to the safe and reliable supply of food and medicine in remote or disaster-affected areas and even in commercial delivery of goods.$\backslash$n $\backslash$nThe state-of-the-art approaches towards the slung load transportation either develop non-linear feedback control laws to stabilize the system to a predefined trajectory or employ open loop off-line trajectory planning schemes to generate optimal control inputs to the system. Most of these techniques often rely on availability of an accurate model of the system backed up with simulation results. Very few results exist which target experimental validation of the proposed method. Based on the findings of the previously conducted literature survey, it appears that the application of closed loop on-line trajectory generation and control schemes to transport a slung payload in swing free manner remains unanswered. The work in this thesis sets off to answer the research questions in this direction and address the issues that come along with experimental validation. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising framework, which provides the means to tackle both the trajectory generation problem and the feedback control problem in an unified manner. As a result, it forms the most important component of this thesis.$\backslash$n $\backslash$nSpecific research problem that is addressed in this thesis is to transport a cable suspended load using quadrotor from one point to another, while minimizing the swing through the use of Linear Time Invariant MPC techniques. A non-linear dynamic model for the quadrotor-slung load system is obtained and the structure within the system dynamics is exploited to decide the control strategy. Two different MPC formulations viz. MPC with integral action and MPC with delta-u formulation are simulated and compared to Linear Quadratic control with integral action which acts as a benchmark controller. Backed with simulation results, it is shown through experimental validation that it is possible to control the swing of cable suspended load using linear control techniques. MPC being an computationally expensive task, state-of-the-art fast optimization solvers such as FORCES PRO is used to achieve on-line implementation of MPC for the quadrotor-slung load system. To this end, a new software framework for implementation of MPC is developed which establishes a wireless link with the quadrotor resulting in a real-time networked control loop.},

abstract = {Executing agile quadrotor maneuvers with cable- suspended payloads is a challenging problem and complica- tions induced by the dynamics typically require trajectory optimization. State-of-the-art approaches often need significant computation time and complex parameter tuning. We present a novel dynamical model and a fast trajectory optimization algorithm for quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload. Our first contribution is a new formulation of the suspended payload behavior, modeled as a link attached to the quadrotor with a combination of two revolute joints and a prismatic joint, all being passive. Differently from state of the art, we do not require the use of hybrid modes depending on the cable tension. Our second contribution is a fast trajectory optimization technique for the aforementioned system. Our model enables us to pose the trajectory optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Desired behaviors of the system (e.g., obstacle avoidance) can easily be formulated within this framework. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of computation speed and guarantees feasibility of the trajectory with respect to both the system dynamics and control input saturation, while utilizing far fewer tuning parameters. We experimentally validate our approach on a real quadrotor showing that our method generalizes to a variety of tasks, such as flying through desired waypoints while avoiding obstacles, or throwing the payload toward a desired target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that three-dimensional, agile maneuvers exploiting the system dynamics have been achieved on quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a multi-level and distributed control system, based on a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, for a multi-body slung-load system. In particular, we consider a swarm of autonomous multi-copters which are connected by wires to a suspended payload. The payload reference trajectory is obtained through a constrained optimization, then the reference trajectory for each UAV is derived on the basis of the known shape of the formation, while taking into account operational constraints such as collision avoidance and cruise speed. Trajectory tracking is performed by a multi-level flight control system based on a MPC technique and a PID control system. Numerical simulations have been performed in order to test the control system in realistic scenarios. In particular, the multi-copters are modeled by the six Degrees-of-Freedom (6DOF) model, the constraint forces on the wires are calculated using the Udwadia–Kalaba equation and the external disturbances (atmospheric turbulence and gust) are included in the simulation. Simulation results are encouraging, thus making the proposed system an appealing candidate for similar applications.},

The model is intended for use in simulation, pilot training, estimation, and control. The model is derived using a redundant coordinate formulation based on Gauss's Principle of Least Constraint using the Udwadia–Kalaba equation and can be used to model all body-to-body slung-load suspension types. The model provides intuitive and easy-to-use means of modeling and simulating different slung-load suspension types. It includes detection of, and response to, wire slackening and tightening, as well as aerodynamic coupling between the helicopter and the load. Furthermore, it is shown how the model can be easily used for multilift systems, either with multiple helicopters or multiple loads. A numerical stabilization algorithm is introduced, and, finally, the use of the model is illustrated through simulations and flight verifications. Nomenclature},

@phdthesis{VandenBos2018,
abstract = {With the decrease in sensor and actuator costs decentralized control strategies have become increasingly attractive, aiming to use multiple simpler robots for achieving a global objec- tive. The problem of reaching the global objective generally results in a consensus problem requiring communication amongst the agents. The cooperative manipulation problem, where a payload is manipulated using multiple robots, poses an attractive alternative: By using the payload's motion as the means of communication, the agents can reach consensus without using explicit communication. The advantage being that no additional bandwidth is required as the number of participating agents increases and all to all communication is effectively achieved. Whereas previous works considered only the translation dynamics this thesis work consid- ers the use of the full rigid body motion as a means of communication, such that the agents reach consensus on the desired wrench and the payload is stabilized at any desired config- uration. As a possible application the towing of an payload by multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) via cables is considered. This brings the additional challenge of underactu- ation from the perspective of each agent, since only forces can be used to control the full payload's motion. The result is a decentralized nonlinear control law for the forces applied to a payload such that consensus is reached amongst the agents, the leader's control action is amplified and the payload is stabilized at any desired configuration. Proofs are constructed via Lyapunov arguments and the applicability of the control design to the Aerial Towing Problem (ATP) is validated in simulation.},

abstract = {We present a constrained optimization method for multi-robot formation control in dynamic environments, where the robots adjust the parameters of the formation, such as size and three-dimensional orientation, to avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles, and to make progress towards their goal. We describe two variants of the algorithm, one for local motion planning and one for global path planning. The local planner first computes a large obstacle-free convex region in a neighborhood of the robots, embedded in position-time space. Then, the parameters of the formation are optimized therein by solving a constrained optimization, via sequential convex programming. The robots navigate towards the optimized formation with individual controllers that account for their dynamics. The idea is extended to global path planning by sampling convex regions in free position space and connecting them if a transition in formation is possible -computed via the constrained optimization. The path of lowest cost to the goal is then found via graph search. The method applies to ground and aerial vehicles navigating in two-and three-dimensional environments among static and dynamic obstacles, allows for reconfiguration, and is efficient and scalable with the number of robots. In particular, we consider two applications, a team of aerial vehicles navigating in formation, and a small team of mobile manipulators that collaboratively carry an object. The approach is verified in experiments with a team of three mobile manipulators and in simulations with a team of up to sixteen Micro Air Vehicles (quadrotors).},

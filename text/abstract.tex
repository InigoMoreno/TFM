\chapter*{Abstract}%

%\acp{UAV} have been thoroughly used for transportation in unpredictable environments. However, one of the limits for these applications is usually the payload mass, as it cannot be too big in relation to the drones' mass. In this thesis, we propose the use of multiple drones for cooperative transportation through strings. In contrast with current approaches for the control of such systems, we propose the use of \ac{NMPC} to achieve more aggressive and agile maneuvers. The control algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated in simulated environments.
